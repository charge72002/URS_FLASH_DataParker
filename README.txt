# URS_FLASH_DataParker
Python code for processing FLASH sim data  (Heintz Bustard Zweibel 2020)

The files for this repository are currently a mess. (As of 30 June 2020. Hopefully this will change.)
For an overview of the work that I've done in the 2020-2021 academic year, see PlottingSummary.ipnyb. In theory, this Jupyter notebook should be a one-stop-shop for a variety of tasks that I have done and will need to do again in the future.

Submodules - These contain other repositories that hold work for the same project. Created during the LASER program, Summer 2021
URS_Athena_Cpp    Contains a copy of the Athena++ code and output data.
                  See: https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena-public-version
URS_Cpp_Learning  Contains files made while I learn C++
